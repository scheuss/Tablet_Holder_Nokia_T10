This construction is a holder for the Nokia T10 tablet. I couldn’t find a good tablet holder for my Nokia T10, so I designed one myself. By rotating the ring gear on the back side, all four pinion gears drive the M3 spindles. This moves all four corners toward the center and clamps the tablet on all edges. It works very well and the tablet looks good in the holder.

On the back side, there is a spherical mount for attaching a suction mount.

The M3×40 mm threaded rod in the middle is used for stability and prevents the sphere from breaking off. The M3 nut inside the sphere needs to be placed during printing. Simply add a stop at a height of 38.6 mm.

The holder was designed using Fusion 360. The gear is designed with the Fusion app GF Gear Generator.

All 3D-printed parts were printed on a Prusa MK3S+ with a layer height of 0.2 mm. Only the five gear parts were printed with a layer height of 0.1 mm.

It can be easily adapted for other tablets such as iPads or Samsung tablets.

Let me know if you have any questions.
